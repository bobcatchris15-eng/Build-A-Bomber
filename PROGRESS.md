# Progress Log

Dated entries, newest first. Written after every major chunk of work as a checkpoint for anyone (Chris, or a fresh session) picking this up cold.

## 2026-07-12 (Sat) — Day 0: Setup

**Shipped:**
- Initialized git repo at `E:\Build-A-Bomber` (was not previously under version control). `.gitignore` excludes bundled engine binaries (Godot exe/zip, UPBGE ~777MB) and the `.godot/` cache — these are large, static, and regenerable, so keeping them out of git keeps checkpoints fast.
- Baseline commit `c6f472f` captures the entire prototype as it stood before this session's changes — the revert target if anything goes sideways.
- Created `PROGRESS.md` (this file) and `DECISIONS_NEEDED.md` for judgment-call tracking.
- `DESIGN_VISION.md` already existed from prior conversation (Chris's Spore/KSP reference points + the Forged-Battalion-trap differentiation test) — this now drives the Sunday audit.

**Verified:**
- Full headless test suite (`run_tests.gd`, 11 suites) — **all green** at baseline. This is the reference point for "did I break anything."

**Next:** Sunday Design Lab audit against `DESIGN_VISION.md` — specifically checking discrete-swap-only vs. continuous tweakables, and whether symmetry-aware editing is real.
